# BowlingGame
Python Class to Score Input from for a Bowling Game

The BowlingGame class calculates the score for a bowling game in which:
	1) There are 10 frames (11 for an ending spare, 12 for an ending strike)
	2) Adding rolls past the above number of frames does nothing
	3) Start the game over to add rolls again and reset score

NOTE: The input 'pinsDown' is the number of pins that fall down after each roll,
	  not the number of total pins fallen in the frame.

There is a corresponding test file 'unittest_BowlingGame.py' that verifies the functionality thoroughly.
